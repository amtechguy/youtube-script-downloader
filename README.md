well obviously it will be the first readme file i have ever written by myself


i will assume anyone who comes across this definetly knows what a youtube link downloader is supposed to do

this was originally built to run on linux machines since i don't actually use "windows" *cough *cough i almost swallowed a bug, well so i will try my best to probably provide the steps needed to run this on linux and windows as well i don't know if there is a 
way for mac users to also use this as well 

why did i write the previous line so long *sigh.

anyway first for "windows" users, yes in quotes just like "mondays"

let' get serious for once enough  of all the bad blanter or whatever the word is


**OFFICIAL STEPS TO RUN THE SCRIPT ON WINDOWS** i wish an AI will take over the steps i am too lazy to try my best

steps

what to have

make sure youhave python installed or make sure make sure it is the latest version

pip(python package manager)

FFmpeg the main thing probaly

so install python and make sure you add it to path or check add to path you can download from the original python site; just type download python in your browser.

install FFmpeg from the official site as well https://ffmpeg.org/download.html 

extract the folder and add the bin folder to your path, i am sorry i do not know the steps to add the bin folder to your path so users should look for external help for this probably youtube or an AI, check version as well after adding to path **ffmpeg -version**

install **yt-dlp** as well you can use the command prompt to install this pip install yt-dip

save the script in a format you will remember and it will be safer to leave it on your desktop unless you know what you are doing, you can safe the script in a txt file but remember to replace the .txt extension with .py so it saves as a python file, that is if 
you are a noob and don't know what you are doing
well the easiest part, to run the script simply navigate to where the script is in cmd you type **cd Desktop** i am definitely sure of this.

type the command **python youtube_downloader.py** or however you saved the script


**HOW THE SCRIPT WORKS**
it will ask you to paste the youtube link

you choose to save it as audio or video

choose the quality you want and then viola(i hope i am right) you start downloading once you select your quality and hit enter.

do not worry about where the files will be saved a folder will be created on your desktop if it is an audio file it will save as audio, if it is a video file it will save as video 



**MAC OS** the MAC maniacs
the steps are pretty similar to that of the windows 

the same requirements as windows so i will move straight to what to install and how to run the script

so according to my findings i can see that MACOS has what they call homebrew and some users might not have it installed on their machines yet so i will do the honor of showing how, according to youtube

run this in the terminal: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"  just copy and paste it bro, no need to type all thses



this script was meant for educational and experimental use only. i am not going down with anyone who gets bullied because of my script. sorry guys
